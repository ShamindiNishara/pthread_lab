# Concurrent_Assignment
This project demonstrates how to implement parallel programming using the Pthread library in C. The program compares the performance of serial and parallel implementations.

1.Download the project files or clone the repository to your local machine.
    
2.Use the following command to compile all .c files and link them with the pthread library
    `gcc *.c -o main_program -lpthread`

3.After successful compilation, run the executable using the following command
    `./main_program`

Output csv files will be saved under the same directory.
Csv files will contain the execution times in micro seconds.
